    <h1>A Tribute To My Mother</h1>
    <p>There is a large list of names that come to mind when I consider the
       ladies I most admire. a group of women who, for a variety of reasons, I consider to be extraordinary
       human beings.</p>
    <p>My female friends include that have recovered from horrifying cancer diagnoses, raised children 
       with severe special needs, overcome significant imposter phenomenon, and built a new career on the 
       back of devastating divorce or lost husbands to illness prematurely.</p>
       <p>But my mother is the only person who has been significant to me for the past 20 years who I haven't 
        yet recognized for the complete person that she is.</p>
    <h2>Values</h2>

    <p>I think she is an amazing and underappreciated person, despite the fact that she is many things
       (mother-daughter relationships may be among the most difficult ones we have in our lifetimes, can't they?).
       Now that I am an adult, I can recognize someone whose values have greatly influenced mine. values that as 
       I've grown older, I've become more conscious of.  She greatly believes in and lives by the following values:
        learning; justice; family and friends; health and well-being. These values have all contributed to her leading 
        a happy and fulfilling life.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>My mother is a learned woman. She attended her prt-primary school in a school called Kiu-River nursery school.
           She later on joined primary school from class 1 to 8 and finished. She qualified to join a good high school, 
           national high school for that matter called Pangani Girls' High School but later on transfrred to MaryHill Girls'
           High School. She studied her four years in High school and passed in her Exams with a good grade to take her to the 
           University. </p>
           <p>She is really smart. She joined United States International University here in Kenya and persued 
           a bachelor of Science in Information technology. She attained a degree and later on continued in the field with a 
           masters'degree in the African Nazarene University. In her school life she has also attained different certificates
            in different areas of courses. </p>
          She Graduated with her Masters'degree and is now also continuing with this field doing her PhD.

          <h4>Family and Friends</h4>
          <p>My mother puts her family and friends first in everything she does. That, in my opinion, is her main goal.
             There have always been guests at my parents' house. Over the years, the delight that comes from entertaining,
              taking care of, and watching over people has remained constant. I received this worth from her. the importance of 
              friends and family and the requirement to care for and love one another. I would not be the person I am now without
               my family and very close friends.</p>


               <p>I most admire my mother for being content with her lot.

                I see a woman who has put in a ton of effort to fully live out her principles. She has been steadfast in her
                 convictions, occasionally clashing with those who see the world differently than she does (and suffering as a result).
                  Even when life wasn't always a bed of roses, I see someone who has made the most of every opportunity</p>
